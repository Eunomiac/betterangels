<!-- 

	Click ANYWHERE within a trait's dot line: RADIAL MENU OPENS ...
		- Remove a Dot
		- Add a Dot
		- Slide a Dot
		... all such actions are broadcast to Chat.
		OR can make it a click anywhere in dot GRID, and have two "Slide" options, one left and one right,
			with "Add" up top and "Remove" below
	Click on a LABEL -> Drag onto another LABEL -> RADIAL MENU OPENS ...
		- If just drop: ROLLS
		- Radial Menu contains modifiers to roll: drag onto those, roll with selected modifier


	ALSO: NEED A CHECKBOX TO MARK PRIMARY SINISTER STRATEGY

	ALSO: Consider combining Human and Demon sections onto Front
		- tooltip with image of power/aspect rules?
		- click to toggle it on/off: when on, it sets a "number of scenes" value (usually 1)
		- also a button for "demon invoked"
		- "end scene" command that decrements all "number of scenes" on powers/aspects by one, toggling off anything that hits zero
			- could also change tooltips at this point to display sins instead of what the trait means
		- "time passes" command that toggles off everything as if lots of scenes have passed
